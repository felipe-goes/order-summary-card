## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 properties

### What I learned

In this project I was able to learn more about the `relative` and `absolute` positioning
in CSS and also could apply the `transition` property.

The positioning is show in the code below. I learned that in order to properly use the
`absolute` position, the parent element should be in `relative` position. This made
structuring the design much easier.

```
.card-plan {
  position: relative;
  background-color: #f8f9fe;
  padding: 20px;
}

.card-plan a {
  position: absolute;
  font-weight: 900;
  top: 37px;
  right: 20px;
}
```

It also was nice to use the `transition` property to give a nice effect when hovering the
button as you can see in the code below.

```
.card-content button {
  width: 100%;
  border: 0px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
  background-color: #382ae1;
  color: #fff;
  transition: background-color 500ms;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on the semantic tags of HTML5 and some cool animations
with CSS3. I also want to use Flexbox and work on a project where I can practice my
JavaScript skills.
